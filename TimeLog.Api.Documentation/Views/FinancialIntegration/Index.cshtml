    <h3>Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        Together with TimeLog Project, you get deeply integrated experiences with your ERP system. Depending on the ERP
        system, TimeLog Project integrate with them in different ways:
    </p>
    <ul class="arrows">
        <li>
            <strong>Fully integrated</strong> - The integration is build into TimeLog Project, no additional installs
            are required. The ERP system is fully SaaS. Depending on the integration, a few setup steps are needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Fully integrated with server install</strong> - The integration is build into TimeLog Project,
            the ERP is most likely installed on specialized servers and require our FinancialHost middleware to work.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For integrations that is fully integrated with server install, TimeLog has developed a middleware software
        to provide the necessary API endpoints for the best integration experience. <strong>
            This middleware is called the
            "FinancialHost"
        </strong>.
    </p>
    <p>The technical architecture for integrations that are fully integrated with server install looks like this:</p>
